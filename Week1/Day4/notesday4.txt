BOOTSTRAP
responsive framework for css
already contains some JavaScript
automatically animated


bootstrap website documentation >

USAGE:
link in header to css


works with containers, columns and rows

bootstrap gives classes and we use them in our css and it already has styling associated with it

to inspect elecements in browser
sources> cdn> npm>dist>css>dist/css>bootstrap.css
so that you can see the whole bootstrap styling file that has thousands of lines of code

HOW TO INSERT ELEMENTS INTO HTML
in html <button class="btn-group-vertical">

-> with the link to button class from bootstrap get automatically styled


to add something to bootstrap style:

add YOUR OWN CLASS AFTER THE NAME OF THE BOOTSTRAP class
<button class="btn-group-vertical MYOWNBUTTONCOLOR">



to overwrite, take exact name of the BS class (here bouttomn), add it to the css and style it otherwise

.btn-group-vertical {
color: white
}


-----
<section class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8"></div>

bootstrap divides rom into 12 columns!!
and each fractions has specific class, such as
.col-md-1
.col-md-4  (this will be 4 times biger)


per default nex tot each other, if size bigger 12, then under each othe

<div class="col-md-8 mt-0"></div>
mt0 is another BS class that adds margin-top 0


--often used "card" TEMPLATE


"role" usage for screenreader used in conjuction with some fucntionality like JS


div class col-sm-12

when my screen is small (also definted by BS), then my column will be 12 columns long (i.e. full width)


col-sm-12 col-mid-8 col-lg-4

when small:>
